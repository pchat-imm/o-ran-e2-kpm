## **might need close proximity, so the ue can connect to gnb consistently without being dropped**

cannot iperf
- it shows too much not okay (nok) to 100%

- [ ] ping from gnb to core
- [x] config quectel: AT command according to: https://www.eurecom.fr/publication/7497/download/comsys-publi-7497.pdf
- [x] check upf and masq gtpu: The UE connects to the Internet via a User Plane Function (UPF) over a masqueraded GTP tunnel.
- [ ] is it issue with PRACH
	- [x] gnb log: The PRACH detector will not meet the performance requirements with the configuration {Format B4, ZCZ 0, SCS 30kHz, Rx ports 1}.
- [x] sim card APN & Core network APN
- [x] enable IP forwarding and add NAT rules to IP tables

quectel
- try roaming 255, and cgdcont=1,"IP" to be IPv4
at+cops?
+cops: 0,0,"Open5GS Magic",11
- wwan0 wirehark shown nothing

## [ ] can sdr ping to the amf?
## ue cannot connect to internet
	- [ ] read discussion forum
	- ask on discussion forum

- suci of pysi: https://gist.github.com/mrlnc/01d6300f1904f154d969ff205136b753



2. Quectel w/ SIM to RPI 
- focus on using `mmcli`

3. need successful performance mode


4. other config on gnb
- [ ] add more number of antenna like this https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_Project/discussions/397
- [ ] change mcs like this https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_Project/discussions/549 
	- this discussion also has gnb config file at the answer to try

other
- set sim as https://himanshup.hashnode.dev/5g-sa-lab-setup-using-srsran-open5gs


	- cannot `wds-start-network` nor `sudo mmcli -m <number> --simple-connect="apn=srsapn"`
		- following this https://superuser.com/questions/985082/is-there-a-way-to-disable-the-dhcp-client-in-raspbian-linux-on-a-rasperry-pi, remove `udhcpc`
		- following this https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_Project/discussions/426
	- see issue on https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_Project/discussions/482
	- set `cdgcont=1,"IP","srsapn"`, recieve `OK`, but `at+cops` still returns incorrect result

5. performance mode
- cpu governor mode
- disable HyperThreading
- disabling virtualisation technology
- enabling thread priority scheduling
- setting socket buffer size
- seting Ethernet MTU values
- setting NIC ring buffer size
